models 
default, abstract, proxy
### default model
### abstract model
### proxy model
They are extension of original model, but not alter original ones.

In Django REST Framework (DRF), APIView and ViewSet are both ways to build APIs, but they serve different purposes and have different trade-offs.

Let’s break it down clearly:

1️⃣ APIView
What it is:
The most basic DRF class-based view.
Think of it like Django’s View, but with DRF’s request/response handling, authentication, and permissions.

How it works:
You manually define each HTTP method (get, post, put, patch, delete, etc.) yourself.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework import status
from .models import Product
from .serializers import ProductSerializer

class ProductListCreateAPIView(APIView):
    def get(self, request):
        products = Product.objects.all()
        serializer = ProductSerializer(products, many=True)
        return Response(serializer.data)

    def post(self, request):
        serializer = ProductSerializer(data=request.data)
        if serializer.is_valid():
            serializer.save()
            return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
        return Response(serializer.errors, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
✅ Advantages

Fine-grained control over request handling.

Explicit and clear.

Good for complex, non-standard endpoints.

⚠️ Disadvantages

More code for common CRUD operations.

Repetition if you need similar patterns across models.

2️⃣ ViewSet
What it is:
A higher-level abstraction that bundles related CRUD actions into a single class.

How it works:
You don’t directly define get/post — instead, you define actions like list, retrieve, create, update, destroy.

Often paired with routers that automatically generate URLs for you.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
from rest_framework import viewsets
from .models import Product
from .serializers import ProductSerializer

class ProductViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):  # Includes list, create, retrieve, update, destroy
    queryset = Product.objects.all()
    serializer_class = ProductSerializer
Then in urls.py:

python
Copy
Edit
from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
from .views import ProductViewSet

router = DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'products', ProductViewSet)

urlpatterns = router.urls
✅ Advantages

Less boilerplate for standard CRUD.

URL routing handled automatically by routers.

Easy to extend with custom actions (@action decorator).

⚠️ Disadvantages

Less explicit — magic happens through routers.

Not as flexible for highly customized endpoints.

When to use what
Use Case	Recommended
Simple CRUD APIs	ViewSet
Needs automatic URL routing	ViewSet
Highly custom behavior per HTTP method	APIView
API endpoint not tied to a model	APIView
Learning DRF basics	Start with APIView

If you want, I can make you a side-by-side CRUD implementation showing APIView vs ViewSet for the same Product model so you can compare the code length and URL patterns directly.
Do you want me to make that?

apiview vs viewset vs generic view 


ChatGPT said:
Alright — let’s put APIView, Generic Views, and ViewSets side by side so you can see exactly how they differ.

1️⃣ APIView
Base Level

Most manual — you implement each HTTP method yourself.

Gives maximum flexibility but more code.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework import status
from .models import Product
from .serializers import ProductSerializer

class ProductAPIView(APIView):
    def get(self, request):
        products = Product.objects.all()
        serializer = ProductSerializer(products, many=True)
        return Response(serializer.data)

    def post(self, request):
        serializer = ProductSerializer(data=request.data)
        if serializer.is_valid():
            serializer.save()
            return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
        return Response(serializer.errors, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
✅ Pros: Full control, flexible.
⚠️ Cons: Repetitive for CRUD.

2️⃣ Generic Views
Mid Level

Inherits from DRF’s GenericAPIView + mixins (ListModelMixin, CreateModelMixin, etc.).

Still flexible, but less boilerplate.

You get CRUD methods from mixins without manually defining them.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
from rest_framework import generics
from .models import Product
from .serializers import ProductSerializer

class ProductListCreateView(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    queryset = Product.objects.all()
    serializer_class = ProductSerializer
✅ Pros: Less code, still customizable.
⚠️ Cons: Must know which mixin/class to use.

Common Generic Views

Class	Purpose
ListAPIView	Only GET (list)
CreateAPIView	Only POST
RetrieveAPIView	Only GET (single)
UpdateAPIView	PUT/PATCH
DestroyAPIView	DELETE
ListCreateAPIView	GET (list) + POST
RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView	GET, PUT/PATCH, DELETE

3️⃣ ViewSet
High Level

Groups CRUD actions into one class (list, retrieve, create, update, destroy).

Paired with routers to auto-generate URLs.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
from rest_framework import viewsets
from .models import Product
from .serializers import ProductSerializer

class ProductViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Product.objects.all()
    serializer_class = ProductSerializer
In urls.py:

python
Copy
Edit
from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
from .views import ProductViewSet

router = DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'products', ProductViewSet)
urlpatterns = router.urls
✅ Pros: Minimal code, auto URLs.
⚠️ Cons: Less explicit control unless overridden.

Summary Table
Feature	APIView	Generic Views	ViewSet
Code Length	Longest	Medium	Shortest
Flexibility	Highest	Medium	Low–Medium
Best For	Fully custom logic	Standard CRUD w/ tweaks	Quick CRUD APIs
URL Handling	Manual	Manual	Automatic via router
Learning Curve	Low	Medium	Medium–High

If you’re doing 90% standard CRUD, go ViewSet.
If you need slight customization, go Generic Views.
If you need full control, go APIView.

If you want, I can make a single Product API implemented in all three styles so you can see how the code size changes from APIView → Generic View → ViewSet. That comparison is really eye-opening.
